DS_DE_ASSIGNMENT/TEST_06
##############################################################################
This test is designed as a placement test to evaluate potential candidates in data science and data engineer fields. It aims to facilate the evaluated candidates to demonstrate desirable skills such as thinking process, data manipulation, data management, data quality management, data processing, logics and algorithm developing, etc., without restrictions of any tools, platform used to acheive the end results.

$$ Objectives $$
Our state-of-HQ issue now (as of 2016), we are aiming to create an automated CPC bidding on our metasearch partner, i.e. seeking an optimal CPC(cost per click) on hotel level using any existing data, reports we acquired.

$$ INSTRUCTIONS $$
We provide sample data inside following S3 folder which are collected between 2017-01-26 and 2017-02-08 (see how to access AWS S3 in APPENDIX B section and columns definition in APPENDIX A section):
- bid_overview 
- click_cost_overview 
- property_overview
Please develop an algorithm/models using any methodologies include time series analysis, non-linear/linear optimization, numerical optimization, or any statisical, machine learning technique to come up with forcasted "optimal CPC" on hotel level on a each silo name. Temporal dimension of the optimal CPC can be daily(up until any arbitary date) or a single date (arbitary date later than 2017-02-08).

Expected output file:
- We need a csv file (with any delimited) with 3 columns: 1) predicted_date, 2) property_id, 3) optimal_CPC. The data in the csv can be "long" or "wide" format or any format that suits your needs or suit for visualzation.
- The preliminary evaluation is we want you to describe how would you define "optima CPC".
- Next, we want you to describe and justify the methodology of your choice. 
- Ideally, you can show how to visualize the end result, let assume the end users of this assignment is CFO or our Metasearch specialist.
- Please also point out discrepancies in the input file if any. 

$$ NOTE $$
- Let assume all datetime, date type are in UTC.
- Let simply this problem by not considering property geolocation, as you might notice in the property_overview file in which we provided only property's city and country.

$$ General hints $$
- # Data is never cleaned, you hands must be dirty # -- Be aware bad data.
- # All models are wrong but some are useful # -- Not necessarily state-of-the-art models or future-proof solutions, few basic ones might be sufficient, please focus on practicality.
- # Make the analysis reproducible # –- We are fine if you black-box methodology with clear explanation.
- # Sky is the limit, with acceptable overhead # –- Try think out of box, and feel free to adopt any methods but please also takes time constriants and computational costs into account. Please contact corresponding recriting personal if you need addition infratructure to perform this assignment.

$$ Input File Column Description $$
Bid Overview is a report containing auction-related data for our HQ property provided by Tripadvisor, which is based on a combination of traffic type, and several other optional parameters.
The bid Overview report consolidates all bid recommendations into a single file containing “state of the bid" inventory for HQ. The goal is to provide as much information as possible to partners to allow us to intelligently bid for Tripadvisor traffic. The default Bid Overview report contains a single row for each property in that is currently in the partner inventory for a given silo. The report includes the following columns:
[1]		silo name

[3]		bid status
	i. Column heading: bid status

		4. Revshare suppressed: offer is active using rev share, but is not being shown (either because the bid is too low, or the property isn’t showing rev share offers at this time)
