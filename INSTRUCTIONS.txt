DS_DE_ASSIGNMENT/TEST_06
##############################################################################
This test is designed as a placement test to evaluate potential candidates in data science and data engineer fields. It aims to facilate the evaluated candidates to demonstrate desirable skills such as thinking process, data manipulation, data management, data quality management, data processing, logics and algorithm developing, etc., without restrictions of any tools, platform used to acheive the end results.

$$ Objectives $$
Our state-of-HQ issue now (as of 2016), we are aiming to create an automated CPC bidding on our metasearch partner, i.e. seeking an optimal CPC(cost per click) on hotel level using any existing data, reports we acquired.

$$ INSTRUCTIONS $$
We provide sample data inside following S3 folder which are collected between 2017-01-26 and 2017-02-08 (see how to access AWS S3 in APPENDIX B section):
- bid_overview 
- click_cost_overview 
- property_overview

Please develop an algorithm/models using any methodologies include time series analysis, non-linear/linear optimization, numerical optimization, or any statisical, machine learning technique to come up with forcasted "optimal CPC" on hotel level on a each silo name. Temporal dimension of the optimal CPC can be daily(up until any arbitary date) or a single date (arbitary date later than 2017-02-08).

Expected output file:
- We need a csv file (with any delimited) with 3 columns: 1) predicted_date, 2) property_id, 3) optimal_CPC. The data in the csv can be "long" or "wide" format or any format that suits your needs or suit for visualzation.
- The preliminary evaluation is we want you to describe how would you define "optima CPC".
- Next, we want you to describe and justify the methodology of your choice. 
- Ideally, you can show how to visualize these let assume the end users of this assignment is CFO or our Metasearch specialist.
- Please also point out discrepancies in the input file if any. 

$$ NOTE $$
- Let assume all datetime, date type are in UTC.
- Let simply this problem by not considering property geolocation, as you might notice in the property_overview file in which we provided only property's city and country.

$$ General hints $$
- # Data is never cleaned, you hands must be dirty # -- Be aware bad data.
- # All models are wrong but some are useful # -- Not necessarily state-of-the-art models or future-proof solutions, few basic ones might be sufficient, please focus on practicality.
- # Make the analysis reproducible # –- We are fine if you black-box methodology with clear explanation.
- # Sky is the limit, with acceptable overhead # –- Try think out of box, and feel free to adopt any methods but please also takes time constriants and computational costs into account. Please contact 

$$ External open data sources $$:
You can try leverage external open data sources such as:
- Yahoo Opendata http://www.opendata500.com/us/yahoo/
- AWS Open Data https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/

Bid Overview is a report containing auction-related data for our HQ property provided by Tripadvisor, which is based on a combination of traffic type, and several other optional parameters.
The bid Overview report consolidates all bid recommendations into a single file containing “state of the bid" inventory for HQ. The goal is to provide as much information as possible to partners to allow us to intelligently bid for Tripadvisor traffic. The default Bid Overview report contains a single row for each property in that is currently in the partner inventory for a given silo. The report includes the following columns:
[1]		silo name
	i. Column heading: silo name
	ii. Silo that contains this offer

[3]		bid status
	i. Column heading: bid status

		3. Revshare visible: offer is active using rev share and is shown
		4. Revshare suppressed: offer is active using rev share, but is not being shown (either because the bid is too low, or the property isn’t showing rev share offers at this time)

Pari-Mike Task 01 2016-10-18
##############################################################################
Objective
- Our issue is that our data we imported into our system from elsewhere is not clean nor complete--there are about 40% of hotels without neccesary info, such as address, city, state(or province), postal code, latitiude, longitude.
- What we need to do is to fill in missing hotel's address using column 'Address1' from ActivePropertyList.csv file(see column definition below), as well as latlong, address, postal code, state, city, country.
- I've tried filling in by reversegeocoding given latlong in googlemap service, but it's not as good as expected. Fortunately, I found that Expedia provide hotel data online. As I primarily sampling-checked the data, I can match several hotels, plus, data in ActivePropertyList.csv are correct when I recheck in Expedia website itself.
- Therefore, the main goal in this task is to match our hotel in given two input file and fill in missing data in bi_410_hotel_data_from_backend.csv.
- The tricky parts here are that we need to fuzzy match not only hotel name, but also need to come up ways to match with other features of hotels (considering the case that we have duplicate hotel name in different cities or even in different countries) 
- Ideally, please also point out discrepancies in the like duplicate hotels or duplicate latlong (unless the hotels are actually located at the same latlong) which might still is inside the data.

Input file
We have 2 Input files, the first one is main data taken from our backend, another one is data avilable in Expedia.
1) bi_410_hotel_data_from_backend.csv
Column description:
 -	hotel_id	: primary key of hotel in our system

 -	lst_country_id	:foreign key of hotel countries in our system
 -	lst_country_name	:hotel country name
 -	hotel_latitude	:latitiude hotel's location 
 -	hotel_longitude	:longitude hotel's location 
 -	hotel_location_address_english	:address hotel's location 
 -	hotel_location_postal_code	:postal code of hotel's location if applicable
 -	hotel_ins_dt	:datetime when the hotel is inserted into our system (just ignore it for now)
 -	hotel_ins_process_id	:insert process by which the hotel is inserted into our system (just ignore it for now)
 -	latlong_query	:concatenated latlong used as one of parameters in reversegeocoding in Google Map Service
 -	ggplace_address	:address obtained by reversegeocoding in Google Map Service
 -	ggplace_postal_code	:postal code obtained by reversegeocoding in Google Map Service

2) ActivePropertyList.csv : this file contains hotel and related data (or property in Expedia), please download from https://www.ian.com/affiliatecenter/include/V2/ActivePropertyList.zip and see column definition as well as more detail from   http://developer.ean.com/database/property-data. 

WARNING:  bi_410_hotel_data_from_backend.csv is not clean-- we can ensure that only hotel_id and hotel_name columns are correct.

Since Mike are not yet able to access Jira, we can try playing with other things like Github Project faeture (https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features). So plase try handing the first task above in github. 
There are no restriction or specific requirements, but just come up with ways how to effectively cooperate with other devs in the same project. You can create a seperate repos in https://github.com/HotelQuickly (make sure to set it as private repos).
